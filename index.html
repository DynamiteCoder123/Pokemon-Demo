        <p>Pokemon is a video game in which you can catch hatch get gifts and battle pokemon you can also in gen 7 can clean your pokemon up after a battle to start I suggest with pokemon red, blue and yellow which are called gen 1 because they are the first generation then go to higher gens. Poketuber are people who post pokemon videos on youtube pokemon websites are places where you can reasearch pokemon. ROMs are read only memories and they can be used through emulators which emulate the game on PC or mobile device. </p>
